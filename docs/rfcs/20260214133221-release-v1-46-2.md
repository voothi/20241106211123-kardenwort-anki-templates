# RFC: v1.46.2 - Advanced Anki Destination Highlighting

## Overview
This release implements a comprehensive word/phrase highlighting system for destination sentences in Anki templates, synchronized with the `kardenwort` processing engine.

## User Requests
- **20260214133221**: Initial request to highlight destination words.
- **20260214141246**: Refinement of highlighting style to "dim" the text (grey out the sentence while keeping matches bright).
- **20260214141742**: Extension of support to `SentenceDestination2`.
- **20260214142406**: Implementation of phrase-based highlighting using semicolon (`;`) separators in `WordDestinationInflectedForm`.
- **20260214143838**: Implementation of an automatic approximate highlighting fallback based on source word position.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Kardenwort Core (`kardenwort.py`)
- Added `WordDestinationInflectedForm` as a new field (column 83) in the Anki CSV export.
- Updated `get_anki_csv_header` and `generate_anki_csv_row` (or equivalent row logic) to accommodate this new field.

### 2. Anki Templates (Basic 2024)
- **Script Refactoring**: The `highlightWords` function was refactored into a generic `highlightField` function that takes a target selector and a custom delimiter regex.
- **Phrase Support**: For destination fields, the delimiter is strictly set to `/[;\n]+/`, allowing the use of spaces within target phrases (e.g., "pomme de terre").
- **Styling**: `Styling.css` was updated with `.sentence-destination` and `.sentence-destination-2` classes. These classes dim the base text, while `u` tags inside them are styled to be bright and clear (without underlines).
- **Automatic Highlighting Fallback**:
  - If `WordDestinationInflectedForm` is empty, the `autoHighlightDestination` function is triggered.
  - It calculates the relative index of the target word in the `SentenceSource`.
  - It maps this index to the `SentenceDestination` and highlights the corresponding word plus one word on each side (3 words total) to provide an approximate highlight.

## Verification
- Verified that highlighting works for both single words and multi-word phrases.
- Verified that the "dimming" effect correctly applies to both destination sentences on the back side.
- Verified that the automatic fallback correctly identifies and highlights the approximate target area when the manual field is empty.
- Verified that the system fails gracefully if fields or elements are missing.
