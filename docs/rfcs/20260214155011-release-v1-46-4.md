# RFC: v1.46.4 - Sentence Fallback and Expansion Logic

## Overview
This release implements fallback logic for phrase cards and automatic expansion logic for vocabulary cards to ensure that translation context is always visible even when primary fields are empty.

## User Requests
- **20260214152502**: Request to show `SentenceDestination` as a fallback if `SentenceDestination2` is empty on phrase cards.
- **20260214153612**: Request to automatically expand `SentenceDestination2` on vocabulary cards if `SentenceDestination` is empty.

## Implementation Details

### Anki Templates (Basic 2024)
- **Metadata Section**: Updated the hidden metadata span to conditionally show `SentenceDestination` if `SentenceDestination2` is missing.
- **TTS Logic**: Added logic to play `SentenceDestination` audio on phrase cards (where `WordSource` is empty) ONLY IF `SentenceDestination2` is also empty.
- **Phrase Card Visibility**: Modified the CSS toggle class for `SentenceDestination`. It now checks if `SentenceDestination2` is present; if not, it remains shown by default.
- **Vocabulary Card Expansion**: Updated the toggle class for `SentenceDestination2`. On vocabulary cards (where `WordSource` is present), if `SentenceDestination` is empty, the toggle class for the second sentence is set to `class="show"`, causing it to expand automatically.

## Verification
- **Verified Phrase Cards**: `SentenceDestination` correctly serves as fallback for display and TTS when `SentenceDestination2` is empty.
- **Verified Vocabulary Cards**: `SentenceDestination2` expands automatically if the primary `SentenceDestination` is empty.
- **Verified Metadata**: Hidden span correctly reflects the fallback content.
